# File Used To track Tasks Assigned To Each Member

Team 118 will use this file to track issues and tasks that have been assigned to them

## Updated core backend scripts for Tasks Assigned To Issues-19

I've added necessary comments for all updated scripts.

- Allow all users to view the different videos on the platform.
- Restrict upload functionality to only registered and logged users.
- Restrict video editing and deleting features to only the user that posted it.
- Map registered users to the videos they uploaded such that if their accounts get deleted, all their videos get deleted along
