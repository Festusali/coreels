# File Used To track Tasks Assigned To Each Member

Team 118 will use this file to track issues and tasks that have been assigned to them

## Updated [tasks.md](tasks.md "Click to open tasks.md") as a guide for fellow team members Issues-16

This is a way to show my team members how to track and fix github issues assigned to them.

- Cloned the repository
- Created a new branch
- Made changes to tasks.md
- Commited my changes
- pushed it to GitHub
